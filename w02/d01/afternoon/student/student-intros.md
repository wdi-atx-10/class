# Looping!

Write a script that loops through all the other students in class and introduce yourself!

```javascript
var students = ["andrew", "matt", "erik", "chris", "sarah", "sam", "salman", "jacob", "remington", "charlie", "tanya", "barbara", "komal", "rene", "jon", "ronak", "matt", "juli", "jorge", "rob", "melissa", "peter", "dan"]
```


## Guidelines
- Use a `console.log` to introduce yourself to each person. Your greeting should say `Hello <name>, how are you? My name is <your name>.`
- You should NOT introduce yourself to yourself. That wouldn't make any sense, would it? Make sure you skip over yourself when making introductions.
- Now, update your script to tell the person you're introducing yourself to how many other people in the class you've already introduced yourself to. So your intro should be something like: `Hello <name>, how are you? My name is <your name>. I've met <number> other people in the class so far!`

## Bonus 1
- Try capitalizing each person's name (as well as your own!) as you're introducing yourself to them. Manners are important.

## Bonus 2
- While you're introducing yourself to each person, also introduce them to another random person in the class. So your prompt might now read:
`Hello <name>, how are you? My name is <your name>. I've met <number> other people in the class so far! Have you met <some other classmate's name>?`
